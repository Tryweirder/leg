# workdir

This package provides utilties for creating and managing working directories. It
defaults to the XDG suite of directory standards from
[freedesktop.org](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/).

The functionality in this package should work on Linux, MacOS and the BSDs.

## TODO

- add a mechanism for root interactions
- add Windows support
